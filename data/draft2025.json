    "scoutingReport": "Trade! The Browns move back into Round 1 to grab their QB-in-waiting. Shedeur, Coach Prime's son, has first-round traits (arm talent, poise) but slipped due to questions about level of competition. Cleveland gives him a year to develop behind Watson before an out in Watson's contract after 2025."
